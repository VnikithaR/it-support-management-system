# IT Support Management System - Helpdesk

## Description
The **Helpdesk** system is a web-based application designed to streamline and manage IT support requests within an organization. Employees can submit IT-related support tickets, and IT staff can efficiently handle, track, and resolve these tickets. The system also includes email notifications, performance analytics, and role management to ensure smooth operations.

## Features
- **Ticket Submission**: Employees can open tickets for IT-related issues through the portal.
- **Ticket Assignment**: Tickets are assigned to IT staff members for resolution.
- **Email Notifications**: Users receive email updates on the status of their tickets.
- **Ticket Tracking**: IT staff can track the status and progress of all tickets.
- **Performance Analytics**: Supervisors can view statistics on ticket resolution times and staff performance.
- **Role Management**: Admin users can manage roles (e.g., IT staff, employees) within the system.
- **Security**: The application includes security configurations to ensure only authorized users can access certain features.

## Technologies Used
- **[Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)** - Framework for building Java-based web applications.
- **[Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)** - Build automation tool used for dependency management and project setup.
- **[Thymeleaf](https://www.thymeleaf.org/)** - Java templating engine for rendering dynamic HTML pages.
- **[jQuery](https://jquery.com/)** and **[AJAX](https://jquery.com/ajax/)** - For implementing asynchronous requests and time tracking functionality.
- **[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)** - Front-end framework for responsive design.
